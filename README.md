- **Redirect Service**: Converts short codes and redirects the user to the original URL.
- **ID Generator Service**: Generates sequential numeric IDs used to derive short codes.
- **Redis Cache**: Stores recently accessed short URL mappings.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores persistent mappings between short and original URLs.
